                    <b>September 2010 to July 2013:</b> BSc Computer Science, University of Hertfordshire
                    <ul>

                    <h4 class = "resume">Experience</h4>
                    Created a data logger for a PIC microcontroller.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This involved creating a GUI menu using C/C++ that would allow the user to choose from several options. This involved coding the following - the memory bank allocation (EEPROM), changing of time intervals, recording data at each defined interval, viewing a memory banks set of data and clearing the data.
                    </ul>
                    Developed a control program for an air conditioning unit of a railway coach using a MPU simulation in Linux.
                    <ul>
                        <li>This involved implementing a simple control algorithm using C/C++, that would dictate which mode the air conditioning unit would need to be in at each specific temperature. This required use of concurrency as multiple threads needed to be executed at the same time, as well as programming both an auto and manual configuration mode.
                    </ul>
                    Created a J2ME mobile client for a chat server using Java.
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was required to design and implement a client that would be able to interact with a provided server using the specified protocols. This required use of concurrency as multiple people were required to be able to communicate at the same time. The functionality would allow a user to login (if constraints are met), retrieve a room list, enter a room, communicate and log out.
                            I have taken an Artificial Intelligence module, which required learning the basics of python, such as recursion, methods and general syntax. I was required to learn how to write different small programs inside python to help with classifying sets of data, heuristics and applying search algorithms.
                            I have three years Java experience spread across several projects/modules during University. I also have one yearâ€™s C/C++ experience from my final year, which had a heavy focus on microcontrollers and multi-threaded programming.
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class = "resume">Technical Skills</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programming Languages: C/C++, Java, Python.
                        <li>Databases: MySQL, PHP.
                        <li>Websites: HTML, HTML5, CSS.
                        <li>Software: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Flash, Adobe Director, Microsoft Office.
                        <li>Operating Systems: Windows, Linux.
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class = "resume">Public Speaking</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have had experience giving oral presentations within a group project.
                        <li>I have given numerous technical demonstrations which required both a presentation and demonstration of a program.
                    </ul>
